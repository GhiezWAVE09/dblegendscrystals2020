How to Get Chrono Crystals in DB Legends
Dragon Ball Legends is a visually stunning fighting game from Bandai Namco. The game’s 3D battles will leave you spellbound. Featuring your favorite DB characters, Legends has a lengthy story mode and a PvP game mode that lets you fight players in real-time battles. You can summon characters and create your own team of fighters.Graphically, Dragon Ball Legends is a stunner! It’s like watching the animated movie, only that you will have complete control over your fighters. There are lots and lots of characters to collect and this guide explains how to get them using crystals.
In DB Legends, chrono crystals (CCs) can be used to summon characters. You can use 20 CCs to summon a single character or 1000 to summon 10 times.
The 20-crystal summon can be used only once per day. You can summon more characters on the same day, but you will be required to spend 100 CCs for summoning additional characters.
To acquire characters, tap “Menu” and then tap the “Summon” button. There will be special events that will let you get rare characters.Unlike other mobile games, Legends lets you choose the next Daily login bonus. Please note that daily login bonuses are different from beginner login rewards.
Under daily bonuses, there are various rewards, such as rising souls, which are used for upgrading equipment and unlocking boost panels to make characters more powerful, Zeni (coins) which can be used to upgrade character and equipment, skip tickets used to skip story battles and CCs.
Bugs and Maintenance Rewards

You will receive 5–10 CCs on completion of a beginner mission. Missions are nothing but certain tasks that you will need to complete to get rewards such as crystals, Zeni, rising souls and Z tickets for player level-ups.These tasks include wearing equipment, completing a particular part of a chapter and several more.

When a battle ends, a screen will display the list of completed challenges with an “acquired” stamp on them.
